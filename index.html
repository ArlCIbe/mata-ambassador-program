    <h3>Buy A Ticket</h3>
    <li>
        Visit the bus company’s website or mobile app, select your route, date, and time, then choose your ticket type. Enter your payment details, and you’ll receive an e-ticket instantly that you can show directly from your phone or email when boarding.</li>
    <li>
        At the Bus Station: Visit the ticket counter at your nearest bus station. The staff will assist you in selecting your route and ticket type, and you can pay using cash, credit, or debit card.
    </li>
    <li>
        Onboard: Some bus services allow you to purchase tickets directly from the driver, usually with cash. However, it’s recommended to buy your ticket in advance to avoid delays.
